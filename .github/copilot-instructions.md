# Copilot Instructions for -souqi-app

## Project Overview
- This project appears to be in its initial setup phase, with minimal documentation and no visible source code or structure beyond the README.
- The README only contains basic git commands for initializing and pushing the repository.

## Immediate Guidance for AI Agents
- **No source code or architecture is present yet.** Before implementing features, confirm the intended tech stack, folder structure, and main application goals with the user.
- **No build, test, or debug workflows are defined.** Ask the user for preferred tools (e.g., Node.js, Python, frameworks) and conventions before generating scripts or automation.
- **No project-specific conventions or patterns are discoverable.** Use standard best practices for the chosen stack until further instructions are provided.
- **No integration points or external dependencies are documented.** If adding dependencies, document them in a `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, or equivalent, and update the README with installation instructions.

## Actionable Steps for AI Agents
1. **Clarify Project Requirements:** Prompt the user for the application's purpose, tech stack, and any existing design decisions.
2. **Establish Structure:** If starting from scratch, propose a standard folder structure and initial files based on the user's goals.
3. **Document Decisions:** Update the README and this file as the project evolves, capturing conventions, workflows, and architectural choices.
4. **Iterate with User Feedback:** After each major change, ask the user to confirm or refine conventions and workflows.

## Example Initial Questions for the User
- What is the main purpose and target platform for this app?
- Which programming language and frameworks should be used?
- Are there any existing design documents or requirements?
- Should any specific build/test tools or deployment workflows be set up?
